Worked on joint projects with a computer architecture research lab under Professor Nam Sung Kim and the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology group. Research topics included Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) Accelerators, Dynamic Binary Translation, Spatial Dataflow Graphs, Heterogeneous SoC Integration, and RTL Design & Verification.

<!--more-->

- Project is to write, verify, layout, and tapeout concept SoC with RISC-V Cores, MESA Mapping Controller, and CGRA
- Developed custom ISA for MESA controller for mapping CPU programs with any CGRA Hardware Accelerator.
- Built custom hardware verification framework complete with golden model to compare DUT v. gold execution traces.
- Verified HDL modules for multiple IPs including modules on AXI protocol integration and Register Files.
- Deployed and validated HDL code through ModelSim, Verilator simulation, and Vivado software.
- Participated in weekly scrums with Samsung SAIT group, developing strong teamwork and communication skills.
