Worked for a robotics research lab on campus under Professor William R. Norris on contracted projects with the Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Research topics included ad hoc mesh network communication, robust localization frameworks, state-space estimation via Kalman-based filters, and hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference architectures.

- Led a team to design and implement outdoor robot localization solution leveraging Ultrawide-Band Antennas by Writing Python & C++ ROS2 packages, deployable on Clearpath Husky & Jackal platforms. 
- Developed PyTorch scripts to tune Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System parameters, implemented SHFAF localization algorithm that improved localization accuracy by 82% to within 10 cm.
- Utilized Python to write localization software and scripts utilizing popular libraries to analyze and process sensor data.
- Customized C firmware and Utilized SPI communication protocol with Decawave UWB Sensors.
- Co-authored IEEE paper on localization methods. Presented progress updates and results to CERL organization under U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, exhibiting strong critical thinking and communication skills.
