excerpt: >-
  Used Cadence Virtuoso and Cadence Innovus tools for VLSI design of a 32-bit
  RISC-V CPU core and FSM controller with custom standard cells. Executed the
  full ASIC flow—RTL design and synthesis, custom 45 nm standard-cell/LEF
  integration, MMMC setup, floorplanning with power-ring + stripe grid, macro
  and timing-driven cell placement, routing, DRC/LVS/timing closure, and final
  GDS-II stream-out.

Used Cadence Virtuoso and Cadence Innovus tools for VLSI design of a 32-bit
  RISC-V CPU core and FSM controller with custom standard cells. Executed the
  full ASIC flow—RTL design and synthesis, custom 45 nm standard-cell/LEF
  integration, MMMC setup, floorplanning with power-ring + stripe grid, macro
  and timing-driven cell placement, routing, DRC/LVS/timing closure, and final
  GDS-II stream-out.  

1. **Custom 45 nm Standard-Cell Library** – Designed and characterized a full FreePDK-45 library (muxes, logic gates, D-flip-flops, tie-cells, endcaps, tap cells) with schematic, layout, parasitic extraction, and Liberty timing/area/power views.
2. **Hand-crafted CPU #1** – Manually floor-planned and laid out a complete 32-bit RISC-V RV32I pipeline (five-stage, byte-addressable) using a **bitsliced** methodology: authored one fully routed 1-bit slice—ALU, write-low/read-high register file, barrel-shifter, and cascaded comparator—and arrayed 32 slices to form the full datapath plus control logic.
3. **Automated CPU #2 via Innovus** – Imported the RTL description and the same custom LEF/Liberty set into Cadence Innovus; executed the entire ASIC back-end flow—MMMC definition, die/core floorplan, M7/M8 power-ring + M7 stripe grid synthesis, macro placement, timing-driven standard-cell placement, global + detailed routing (M2–M6), DRC/LVS/timing closure, and GDS-II stream-out. Register file was a custom manually laid out cell from CPU #1, which was packaged into .lib/.lef and swapped in the reference RTL, replacing the autogenerated memory.
