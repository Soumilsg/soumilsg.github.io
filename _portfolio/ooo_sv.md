date: 2024-05-09
order: 2
layout: single
excerpt: >-
  Designed & verified from scratch an out-of-order N-way parameterizable explicit-register-renaming-based processor for RISC-V 32-bit ISA with M-extension, achieving IPC of 0.51 on standard benchmark taking 62.7 mW of power at clock frequency 325 MHz. Simulated via Synopsys VCS, verified synthesis and functionality via Synopsys DC, Synopsys Lint, SystemVerilog Functional Coverage, debugged via Verdi, RVFI Monitor, and Spike. Autogenerated assembly test files, initialized memory, built toolchains via Python, bash, and GNU make.

* Implemented speculative branching with branch prediction overriding, & perceptron and Gshare branch predictors.
* Implemented cache features including next-line & stride prefetchers, post-commit store buffer with write coalescing.
* Integrated Synopsys IPs including sequential divider, and wrote Dadda advanced multiplier and shift-add multiplier.
* Wrote full processor in SystemVerilog, Debugged with Verdi, Spike, RVFI, Used Python to generate test programs.
